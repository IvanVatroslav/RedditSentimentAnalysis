# Croatian Reddit Sentiment Analysis

**Status: ðŸš§ Work in Progress**

For preliminary analysis, see the [presentation notebook](notebooks/presentation.ipynb).

## Project Overview
This project is currently focused on collecting and analyzing restaurant reviews in Croatian. The findings from this exploratory phase will support the development of a sentiment analysis model tailored for Croatian language, which will then be applied to Croatian Reddit titles.

## Data Exploration
Initial explorations, including visualizations like word clouds from restaurant reviews, can be found in the [presentation notebook](notebooks/presentation.ipynb). This exploration will inform the sentiment analysis techniques to be used for Reddit data.

## Motivation
The goal is to build a sentiment analysis model that understands the nuances of the Croatian language. By starting with restaurant reviews, we aim to refine our methods before tackling the complexity of Croatian Reddit titles. This step is crucial for ensuring accuracy when the model is applied to the Croatian Reddit community sentiment analysis.
